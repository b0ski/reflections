What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Meta file is created. It contains all version of commited files and othe data which is necessary for repo
- it is necessary to initialize a repository in order to show to git wich files I want to track

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is virtual directory wich can contain different groups of files. It probably gives an opportunity to add same files to differnt staging areas
